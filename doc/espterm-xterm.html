<h2><a name="h2-Control-Bytes_-Characters_-and-Sequences" id="h2-Control-Bytes_-Characters_-and-Sequences">Control Bytes, Characters, and Sequences</a></h2>

<pre>
ECMA-48 (aka "ISO 6429") documents C1 (8-bit) and C0 (7-bit) codes.
Those are respectively codes 128 to 159 and 0 to 31.  ECMA-48 avoids
referring to these codes as characters, because that term is associated
with <i>graphic</i> <i>characters</i>.  Instead, it uses "bytes" and "codes", with
occasional lapses to "characters" where the meaning cannot be mistaken.

Controls (including the escape code 27) are processed once:

<b>o</b> This means that a C1 control can be mistaken for badly-formed UTF-8
  when the terminal runs in UTF-8 mode because C1 controls are valid
  <i>continuation</i> <i>bytes</i> of a UTF-8 encoded (multibyte) value.

<b>o</b> It is not possible to use a C1 control obtained from decoding the
  UTF-8 text, because that would require reprocessing the data.  Conse-
  quently there is no ambiguity in the way this document uses the term
  "character" to refer to bytes in a control sequence.

<ins block>
	<p>ESPTerm implements 7-bit mode with full UTF-8 support enabled at all times.
	C1 codes thus cannot be used with the terminal.</p>

	<p>Bytes with the highest bit set (0x80-0xFF) are interpreted as part of a UTF-8
	code point and if the received multi-byte sequence is invalid, they are
	discarded.</p>
</ins>
The order of processing is a necessary consequence of the way ECMA-48 is
designed:

<b>o</b> Each byte sent to the terminal can be unambiguously determined to fall
  into one of a few categories (C0, C1 and graphic characters).

<b>o</b> ECMA-48 is <i>modal</i>; once it starts processing a control sequence, the
  terminal continues until the sequence is complete, or some byte is
  found which is not allowed in the sequence.

<b>o</b> Intermediate, parameter and final bytes may use the same codes as
  graphic characters, but they are processed as part of a control
  sequence and are not actually graphic characters.

<del><b>o</b> Eight-bit controls can have intermediate, etc., bytes in the range 160
  to 255.  Those can be treated as their counterparts in the range 32 to
  127.</del>

<b>o</b> Single-byte controls can be handled separately from multi-byte control
  sequences because ECMA-48's rules are unambiguous.

  As a special case, ECMA-48 (section 9) mentions that the control func-
  tions shift-in and shift-out are allowed to occur within a 7-bit
  multibyte control sequence because those cannot alter the meaning of
  the control sequence.

<b>o</b> Some controls (such as OSC ) introduce a string mode, which is ended
  on a ST  (string terminator).

  Again, the terminal should accept single-byte controls within the
  string. <del>However, <i>xterm</i> has a resource setting <b>brokenLinuxOSC</b> to allow
  recovery from applications which rely upon malformed palette sequences
  used by the Linux console.</del>

<ins block>
	<p>ESPTerm allows only graphic characters and UTF-8 in string mode commands like OSC.</p>
	<p>Low ASCII control characters (< 32) are acted upon immediately on reception, with the
	exception of ST and BEL, which both terminate the string and execute the command.</p>

	<p>CAN and SUB cause an immediate reset of the parser, discarding any command or
	sequence currently being processed.</p>

<h2><a name="h2-VT100-Mode" id="h2-VT100-Mode">VT100 Mode</a></h2>
<pre>
Most of these control sequences are standard VT102 control sequences,
but there is support for later DEC VT terminals (i.e., VT220, VT320,
VT420, VT510), as well as ISO 6429 and <i>aixterm</i> color controls.  The only
VT102 feature not supported is auto-repeat, since the only way X pro-
vides for this will affect all windows.
There are additional control sequences to provide <i>xterm-</i>dependent func-
tions, such as the scrollbar or window size.  Where the function is
specified by DEC or ISO 6429, the code assigned to it is given in paren-
theses.
The escape codes to designate and invoke character sets are specified by
ISO 2022 (see that document for a discussion of character sets).
Many of the features are optional; <i>xterm</i> can be configured and built
without support for them.

            <i>Pv</i> can be omitted except when setting (<i>Pa</i> == 3 ).

            <i>Pv</i> = <i>width</i>; <i>height</i> &lt;- Two integers for graphics geometry.

          <i>xterm</i> replies with a control sequence of the same form:

          where <i>Ps</i> is the status:
            <i>Ps</i> = 0  -&gt; success.
            <i>Ps</i> = 1  -&gt; error in <i>Pi</i>.

            <i>Ps</i> = 3  -&gt; failure.

          On success, <i>Pv</i> represents the value read or set.

          <b>Notes</b>:
          <b>o</b> The current implementation allows reading the graphics
            sizes, but disallows modifying those sizes because that is
            done once, using resource-values.
          <b>o</b> Graphics geometry is not necessarily the same as "window
            size" (see the dtterm window manipulation extensions). For
            example, <i>xterm</i> limits the maximum graphics geometry at com-
            pile time (1000x1000 as of version 328) although the window
            size can be larger.
          <b>o</b> While resizing a window will always change the current
            graphics geometry, the reverse is not true.  Setting graph-
            ics geometry does not affect the window size.</del>

          versions 8-15, and if supported, the remainder of the 88-color
          or 256-color table.

          If a "?" is given rather than a name or RGB specification,
          <i>xterm</i> replies with a control sequence of the same form which
          can be used to set the corresponding color.  Because more than
          one pair of color number and specification can be given in one
          control sequence, <i>xterm</i> can make more than one reply.

            <i>Ps</i> = 5 ; <i>c</i>; <i>spec</i> -&gt; Change Special Color Number <i>c</i> to the
          color specified by <i>spec</i>.  This can be a name or RGB specifica-

          given.  The special colors can also be set by adding the maxi-
          mum number of colors to these codes in an OSC 4  control:

          The 10 colors (below) which may be set or queried using 1 0
          through 1 9  are denoted <i>dynamic</i> <i>colors</i>, since the correspond-
          ing control sequences were the first means for setting <i>xterm</i>'s
          colors dynamically, i.e., after it was started.  They are not
          the same as the ANSI colors.  These controls may be disabled
          using the <i>allowColorOps</i> resource.  At least one parameter is
          expected for <i>Pt</i>.  Each successive parameter changes the next
          color in the list.  The value of <i>Ps</i> tells the starting point
          in the list.  The colors are specified by name or RGB specifi-
          cation as per <i>XParseColor</i>.

          If a "?" is given rather than a name or RGB specification,
          <i>xterm</i> replies with a control sequence of the same form which
          can be used to set the corresponding dynamic color.  Because
          more than one pair of color number and specification can be
          given in one control sequence, <i>xterm</i> can make more than one
          reply.

          using the <i>allowFontOps</i> resource.  If <i>Pt</i> begins with a "#",
          index in the font menu, relative (if the next character is a
          plus or minus sign) or absolute.  A number is expected but not
          required after the sign (the default is the current entry for
          relative, zero for absolute indexing).
          The same rule (plus or minus sign, optional number) is used
          when querying the font.  The remainder of <i>Pt</i> is ignored.
          A font can be specified after a "#" index expression, by
          adding a space and then the font specifier.
          If the "TrueType Fonts" menu entry is set (the <b>renderFont</b>
          resource), then this control sets/queries the <b>faceName</b>
          resource.

            <i>Ps</i> = 5 1  -&gt; reserved for Emacs shell.

            <i>Ps</i> = 5 2  -&gt; Manipulate Selection Data.  These controls may
          be disabled using the <i>allowWindowOps</i> resource.  The parameter
          <i>Pt</i> is parsed as
               <i>Pc</i>; <i>Pd</i>
          The first, <i>Pc</i>, may contain zero or more characters from the
          set c  p  s  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 .  It is used to construct
          a list of selection parameters for clipboard, primary, select,
          or cut buffers 0 through 7 respectively, in the order given.
          If the parameter is empty, <i>xterm</i> uses s 0 , to specify the
          configurable primary/clipboard selection and cut buffer 0.
          The second parameter, <i>Pd</i>, gives the selection data.  Normally
          this is a string encoded in base64.  The data becomes the new
          selection, which is then available for pasting by other appli-
          cations.
          If the second parameter is a ? , <i>xterm</i> replies to the host
          with the selection data encoded using the same protocol.
          If the second parameter is neither a base64 string nor ? ,
          then the selection is cleared.

            <i>Ps</i> = 1 0 4 ; <i>c</i> -&gt; Reset Color Number <i>c</i>.  It is reset to the
          color specified by the corresponding X resource.  Any number
          of <i>c</i> parameters may be given.  These parameters correspond to
          the ANSI colors 0-7, their bright versions 8-15, and if sup-
          ported, the remainder of the 88-color or 256-color table.  If
          no parameters are given, the entire table will be reset.

            <i>Ps</i> = 1 0 5 ; <i>c</i> -&gt; Reset Special Color Number <i>c</i>.  It is reset
          to the color specified by the corresponding X resource.  Any
          number of <i>c</i> parameters may be given.  These parameters corre-
          spond to the special colors which can be set using an OSC 5
          control (or by adding the maximum number of colors using an
          OSC 4  control).

            <i>Ps</i> = 1 0 6 ; <i>c</i>; <i>f</i> -&gt; Enable/disable Special Color Number <i>c</i>.
          The second parameter tells <i>xterm</i> to enable the corresponding
          color mode if nonzero, disable it if zero.

              <i>Pc</i> = 0  &lt;- resource <b>colorBDMode</b> (BOLD).
              <i>Pc</i> = 1  &lt;- resource <b>colorULMode</b> (UNDERLINE).

              <i>Pc</i> = 3  &lt;- resource <b>colorRVMode</b> (REVERSE).
              <i>Pc</i> = 4  &lt;- resource <b>colorITMode</b> (ITALIC).
              <i>Pc</i> = 5  &lt;- resource <b>colorAttrMode</b> (Override ANSI).

          The <i>dynamic</i> <i>colors</i> can also be reset to their default
          (resource) values:
            <i>Ps</i> = 1 1 0  -&gt; Reset VT100 text foreground color.
            <i>Ps</i> = 1 1 1  -&gt; Reset VT100 text background color.

<ins block>
<p>ESPTerm does not implement Alt and Meta keys, however it implements Ctrl and some Shift keys.
For more info, please move on to the next section.</p>
</ins>
<pre><del>
Many keyboards have keys labeled "Alt".  Few have keys labeled "Meta".
However, <i>xterm</i>'s default translations use the <i>Meta</i> modifier.  Common
keyboard configurations assign the <i>Meta</i> modifier to an "Alt" key.  By
using <i>xmodmap</i> one may have the modifier assigned to a different key, and
have "real" alt and meta keys.  Here is an example:

     ! put meta on mod3 to distinguish it from alt
     keycode 64 = Alt_L
     clear mod1
     add mod1 = Alt_L
     keycode 115 = Meta_L
     clear mod3
     add mod3 = Meta_L

The <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource (and <b>altSendsEscape</b> if <b>altIsNotMeta</b> is set)
can be used to control the way the <i>Meta</i> modifier applies to ordinary
keys unless the <b>modifyOtherKeys</b> resource is set:
          - prefix a key with the ESC  character.
          - shift the key from codes 0-127 to 128-255 by adding 128.

The table shows the result for a given character "x" with modifiers
according to the default translations with the resources set on or off.
This assumes <b>altIsNotMeta</b> is set:

       -----------------------------------------------------------
       <b>key</b>          <b>altSendsEscape</b>   <b>metaSendsEscape</b>   <b>result</b>

<ins block>
<p>
	ESPTerm's implementation of key codes is mostly based on this section and on what is expected by real
	applications. For example, the MicroMite Basic does not support SS3 codes, so there is a toggle for those
	in the settings.
</p>

<p>A quick summary of keyboard support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any graphic characters, including UTF-8 code points, can be sent directly from the keyboard. On Android,
	the soft keyboard can be opened by tapping the keyboard icon beneath the screen.</li>
	<li>Ctrl+A..Z produce low ASCII codes (A = 1, through Z = 26), Ctrl+],/,[,^,_ produce codes 27 through 31.</li>
	<li>Cursor keys, Home and End can be switched between CSI and SS3 mode by <code>DECCKM</code>.</li>
	<li>The codes sent by F1-F4, Home and End can be adjusted by toggles on the config page.</li>
	<li>The numeric keypad, if your machine has it, can send alternate key codes if the terminal is switched
	to "Application Keypad Mode". This is described below, look for <code>DECKPAM</code> and <code>DECKPNM</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
	In general, the best way to check what codes are sent is to look at the UART output with an
	application like GtkTerm or PuTTY, if they can show the codes without interpreting them.
	Alternatively, connect ESPTerm to a Linux machine, start <code>agetty</code> on the serial port,
	run <code>cat</code> in shell and press they keys you're interested in. It will first show them
	as plaintext, then interpret them when you press enter. Incidentally, this can also be used
	to test escape sequences and application support. ESPTerm is known to run eg. mc, neovim or nano without issues.
</p>

<pre>
If <i>xterm</i> does minimal translation of the function keys, it usually does
this with a PC-style keyboard, so PC-style function keys result.  Sun
keyboards are similar to PC keyboards.  Both have cursor and scrolling
operations printed on the keypad, which duplicate the smaller cursor and
scrolling keypads.

X does not predefine NumLock (used for VT220 keyboards) or Alt (used as
an extension for the Sun/PC keyboards) as modifiers.  These keys are
recognized as modifiers when enabled by the <b>numLock</b> resource, or by the
"DECSET 1 0 3 5 " control sequence.</del>

The cursor keys transmit the following escape sequences depending on the
mode specified via the <b>DECCKM</b> escape sequence.

                  <b>Key</b>            <b>Normal</b>     <b>Application</b>
                  -------------+----------+-------------
                  Cursor Up    | CSI A    | SS3 A
                  Cursor Down  | CSI B    | SS3 B
                  Cursor Right | CSI C    | SS3 C
                  Cursor Left  | CSI D    | SS3 D
                  -------------+----------+-------------

The home- and end-keys (unlike PageUp and other keys also on the 6-key
editing keypad) are considered "cursor keys" by <i>xterm</i>.  Their mode is
also controlled by the <b>DECCKM</b> escape sequence:

                    <b>Key</b>        <b>Normal</b>     <b>Application</b>
                    ---------+----------+-------------
                    Home     | CSI H    | SS3 H
                    End      | CSI F    | SS3 F
                    ---------+----------+-------------

The application keypad transmits the following escape sequences depend-
ing on the mode specified via the <b>DECKPNM</b> and <b>DECKPAM</b> escape sequences.
Use the NumLock key to override the application mode.

Not all keys are present on the Sun/PC keypad (e.g., PF1, Tab), but are
supported by the program.

They also provide 12 function keys, as well as a few other special-pur-
pose keys:

                       ---------+-----------------

Note that F1 through F4 are prefixed with SS3 , while the other keys are
prefixed with CSI .  Older versions of <i>xterm</i> implement different escape
sequences for F1 through F4, with a CSI  prefix.  These can be activated
by setting the <b>oldXtermFKeys</b> resource.  However, since they do not cor-
respond to any hardware terminal, they have been deprecated.  (The DEC
VT220 reserves F1 through F5 for local functions such as <b>Setup</b>).

                       <b>Key</b>        <b>Escape</b> <b>Sequence</b>
                       ---------+-----------------

                       ---------+-----------------

In normal mode, i.e., a Sun/PC keyboard when the <b>sunKeyboard</b> resource is
false (and none of the other keyboard resources such as <b>oldXtermFKeys</b>
resource is set), <i>xterm</i> encodes function key modifiers as parameters
appended before the <i>final</i> character of the control sequence.  As a spe-
cial case, the SS3  sent before F1 through F4 is altered to CSI  when
sending a function key modifier as a parameter.

                     16    | Meta + Ctrl + Alt + Shift
                  ---------+---------------------------

For example, shift-F5 would be sent as CSI 1 5 ; 2 ~

If the <b>alwaysUseMods</b> resource is set, the Meta modifier also is recog-
nized, making parameters 9 through 16.

<h2><a name="h2-The-Alternate-Screen-Buffer" id="h2-The-Alternate-Screen-Buffer">The Alternate Screen Buffer</a></h2>

<ins block>ESPTerm implements this feature only partly due to RAM constraints. See <a href="#SET1047"><code>CSI ? 1 0 4 7 h</code></a> (above) for more details.</ins>
<pre>
<i>Xterm</i> maintains two screen buffers.  The normal screen buffer allows you
to scroll back to view saved lines of output up to the maximum set by
the <b>saveLines</b> resource.  The alternate screen buffer is exactly as large
as the display, contains no additional saved lines.  When the alternate
screen buffer is active, you cannot scroll back to view saved lines.
<i>Xterm</i> provides control sequences and menu entries for switching between
the two.

Most full-screen applications use terminfo or termcap to obtain strings
used to start/stop full-screen mode, i.e., <i>smcup</i> and <i>rmcup</i> for terminfo,
or the corresponding <i>ti</i> and <i>te</i> for termcap.  The <b>titeInhibit</b> resource
removes the <i>ti</i> and <i>te</i> strings from the TERMCAP string which is set in
the environment for some platforms.  That is not done when <i>xterm</i> is
built with terminfo libraries because terminfo does not provide the
whole text of the termcap data in one piece.  It would not work for ter-
minfo anyway, since terminfo data is not passed in environment vari-
ables; setting an environment variable in this manner would have no
effect on the application's ability to switch between normal and alter-
nate screen buffers.  Instead, the newer private mode controls (such as
1 0 4 9 ) for switching between normal and alternate screen buffers sim-
ply disable the switching.  They add other features such as clearing the
display for the same reason: to make the details of switching indepen-
dent of the application that requests the switch.

When bracketed paste mode is set, pasted text is bracketed with control

<h2><a name="h2-Title-Modes" id="h2-Title-Modes">Title Modes</a></h2>
<pre><del>
The window- and icon-labels can be set or queried using control
sequences.  As a VT220-emulator, <i>xterm</i> "should" limit the character
encoding for the corresponding strings to ISO-8859-1.  Indeed, it used
to be the case (and was documented) that window titles had to be
ISO-8859-1.  This is no longer the case.  However, there are many appli-
cations which still assume that titles are set using ISO-8859-1.  So
that is the default behavior.

If <i>xterm</i> is running with UTF-8 encoding, it is possible to use window-
and icon-labels encoded using UTF-8.  That is because the underlying X
libraries (and many, but not all) window managers support this feature.

The <b>utf8Title</b> X resource setting tells <i>xterm</i> to disable a reconversion
of the title string back to ISO-8859-1, allowing the title strings to be
interpreted as UTF-8.  The same feature can be enabled using the title
mode control sequence described in this summary.

Separate from the ability to set the titles, <i>xterm</i> provides the ability
to query the titles, returning them either in ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8.  This
choice is available only while <i>xterm</i> is using UTF-8 encoding.

Finally, the characters sent to, or returned by a title control are less
constrained than the rest of the control sequences.  To make them more
manageable (and constrained), for use in shell scripts, <i>xterm</i> has an
optional feature which decodes the string from hexadecimal (for setting
titles) or for encoding the title into hexadecimal when querying the
value.

</ins>
<pre><del>
The VT widget can be set to send the mouse position and other informa-
tion on button presses.  These modes are typically used by editors and
other full-screen applications that want to make use of the mouse.

There are two sets of mutually exclusive modes:
<b>o</b> mouse protocol
<b>o</b> protocol encoding

The mouse protocols include DEC Locator mode, enabled by the DECELR CSI
<i>Ps</i> ; <i>Ps</i>  '  z control sequence, and is not described here (control
sequences are summarized above).  The remaining five modes of the mouse
protocols are each enabled (or disabled) by a different parameter in the
"DECSET CSI ? <i>Pm</i> h " or "DECRST CSI ? <i>Pm</i> l " control sequence.

Manifest constants for the parameter values are defined in <b>xcharmouse.h</b>
as follows:

     #define SET_X10_MOUSE               9
     #define SET_VT200_MOUSE             1000
     #define SET_VT200_HIGHLIGHT_MOUSE   1001
     #define SET_BTN_EVENT_MOUSE         1002
     #define SET_ANY_EVENT_MOUSE         1003

     #define SET_FOCUS_EVENT_MOUSE       1004

     #define SET_EXT_MODE_MOUSE          1005
     #define SET_SGR_EXT_MODE_MOUSE      1006
     #define SET_URXVT_EXT_MODE_MOUSE    1015

     #define SET_ALTERNATE_SCROLL        1007

The motion reporting modes are strictly <i>xterm</i> extensions, and are not
part of any standard, though they are analogous to the DEC VT200 DECELR
locator reports.

Normally, parameters (such as pointer position and button number) for
all mouse tracking escape sequences generated by <i>xterm</i> encode numeric
parameters in a single character as <i>value</i>+32.  For example, !  specifies
the value 1.  The upper left character position on the terminal is
denoted as 1,1.  This scheme dates back to X10, though the normal mouse-
tracking (from X11) is more elaborate.

X10 compatibility mode sends an escape sequence only on button press,
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed.  It is enabled by
specifying parameter 9 to DECSET.  On button press, <i>xterm</i> sends CSI M
<i>CbCxCy</i> (6 characters).
<b>o</b> <i>Cb</i> is button-1.
<b>o</b> <i>Cx</i> and <i>Cy</i> are the x and y coordinates of the mouse when the button was
  pressed.

</del></pre>
<h2><a name="h2-Normal-tracking-mode" id="h2-Normal-tracking-mode">Normal tracking mode</a></h2>
<pre><del>
Normal tracking mode sends an escape sequence on both button press and
release.  Modifier key (shift, ctrl, meta) information is also sent.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1000 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, <i>xterm</i> sends CSI M <i>CbCxCy</i>.
<b>o</b> The low two bits of <i>Cb</i> encode button information: 0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2
  pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.
<b>o</b> The next three bits encode the modifiers which were down when the but-
  ton was pressed and are added together:  4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.
  Note however that the shift and control bits are normally unavailable
  because <i>xterm</i> uses the control modifier with mouse for popup menus,
  and the shift modifier is used in the default translations for button
  events.  The <i>Meta</i> modifier recognized by <i>xterm</i> is the <i>mod1</i> mask, and
  is not necessarily the "Meta" key (see <i>xmodmap</i>).
<b>o</b> <i>Cx</i> and <i>Cy</i> are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event, encoded as

<h2><a name="h2-Wheel-mice" id="h2-Wheel-mice">Wheel mice</a></h2>

Wheel mice may return buttons 4 and 5.  Those buttons are represented by
the same event codes as buttons 1 and 2 respectively, except that 64 is
added to the event code.  Release events for the wheel buttons are not
reported.  By default, the wheel mouse events are translated to <i>scroll-</i>
<i>back</i> and <i>scroll-forw</i> actions.  Those actions normally scroll the whole
window, as if the scrollbar was used.  However if Alternate Scroll mode
is set, then cursor up/down controls are sent when the terminal is dis-
playing the alternate screen.  The initial state of Alternate Scroll
mode is set using the <b>alternateScroll</b> resource.

</del></pre>
<h2><a name="h2-Highlight-tracking" id="h2-Highlight-tracking">Highlight tracking</a></h2>
<pre><del>
Mouse highlight tracking notifies a program of a button press, receives
a range of lines from the program, highlights the region covered by the
mouse within that range until button release, and then sends the program
the release coordinates.  It is enabled by specifying parameter 1001 to
DECSET.  Highlighting is performed only for button 1, though other but-
ton events can be received.

<b>Warning:</b> use of this mode requires a cooperating program or it will hang
<i>xterm.</i>

On button press, the same information as for normal tracking is gener-
ated; <i>xterm</i> then waits for the program to send mouse tracking informa-
tion.  <i>All</i> <i>X</i> <i>events</i> <i>are</i> <i>ignored</i> <i>until</i> <i>the</i> <i>proper</i> <i>escape</i> <i>sequence</i> <i>is</i>
<i>received</i> <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>pty:</i> CSI <i>Ps</i> ; <i>Ps</i> ; <i>Ps</i> ; <i>Ps</i> ; <i>Ps</i> T .  The parameters
are <i>func,</i> <i>startx,</i> <i>starty,</i> <i>firstrow,</i> and <i>lastrow.</i>  <i>func</i> is non-zero to
initiate highlight tracking and zero to abort.  <i>startx</i> and <i>starty</i> give
the starting x and y location for the highlighted region.  The ending
location tracks the mouse, but will never be above row <i>firstrow</i> and will
always be above row <i>lastrow.</i>  (The top of the screen is row 1.)  When
the button is released, <i>xterm</i> reports the ending position one of two
ways:
<b>o</b> if the start and end coordinates are the same locations:
  CSI t <i>CxCy</i>.
<b>o</b> otherwise:
  CSI T <i>CxCyCxCyCxCy</i>.
  The parameters are <i>startx,</i> <i>starty,</i> <i>endx,</i> <i>endy,</i> <i>mousex,</i> and <i>mousey.</i>
  - <i>startx,</i> <i>starty,</i> <i>endx,</i> and <i>endy</i> give the starting and ending charac-
    ter positions of the region.
  - <i>mousex</i> and <i>mousey</i> give the location of the mouse at button up, which
    may not be over a character.

<h2><a name="h2-Button-event-tracking" id="h2-Button-event-tracking">Button-event tracking</a></h2>
<pre><del>
Button-event tracking is essentially the same as normal tracking, but
<i>xterm</i> also reports button-motion events.  Motion events are reported
only if the mouse pointer has moved to a different character cell.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1002 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, <i>xterm</i> sends the same codes used by normal tracking mode.
<b>o</b> On button-motion events, <i>xterm</i> adds 32 to the event code (the third
  character, <i>Cb</i>).
<b>o</b> The other bits of the event code specify button and modifier keys as
  in normal mode.  For example, motion into cell x,y with button 1 down
  is reported as CSI M @ <i>CxCy</i>.  ( @  = 32 + 0 (button 1) + 32 (motion
  indicator) ).  Similarly, motion with button 3 down is reported as CSI
  M B <i>CxCy</i>.  ( B  = 32 + 2 (button 3) + 32 (motion indicator) ).

<h2><a name="h2-Any-event-tracking" id="h2-Any-event-tracking">Any-event tracking</a></h2>

<pre><del>
FocusIn/FocusOut can be combined with any of the mouse events since it

when the terminal gains focus, and CSI O  when it loses focus.

</del></pre>
<h2><a name="h2-Extended-coordinates" id="h2-Extended-coordinates">Extended coordinates</a></h2>
<pre><del>
The original X10 mouse protocol limits the <i>Cx</i> and <i>Cy</i> ordinates to 223
(=255 - 32).  <i>Xterm</i> supports more than one scheme for extending this
range, by changing the protocol encoding:
UTF-8 (1005)
          This enables UTF-8 encoding for <i>Cx</i> and <i>Cy</i> under all tracking
          modes, expanding the maximum encodable position from 223 to
          2015.  For positions less than 95, the resulting output is
          identical under both modes.  Under extended mouse mode, posi-
          tions greater than 95 generate "extra" bytes which will con-
          fuse applications which do not treat their input as a UTF-8
          stream.  Likewise, <i>Cb</i> will be UTF-8 encoded, to reduce confu-
          sion with wheel mouse events.
          Under normal mouse mode, positions outside (160,94) result in
          byte pairs which can be interpreted as a single UTF-8 charac-
          ter; applications which do treat their input as UTF-8 will
          almost certainly be confused unless extended mouse mode is
          active.
          This scheme has the drawback that the encoded coordinates will
          not pass through <i>luit</i> unchanged, e.g., for locales using non-
          UTF-8 encoding.
SGR (1006)
          The normal mouse response is altered to use CSI &lt; followed by
          semicolon-separated encoded button value, the <i>Cx</i> and <i>Cy</i> ordi-
          nates and a final character which is M  for button press and m
          for button release.
          <b>o</b> The encoded button value in this case does not add 32 since
            that was useful only in the X10 scheme for ensuring that the
            byte containing the button value is a printable code.
          <b>o</b> The modifiers are encoded in the same way.
          <b>o</b> A different final character is used for button release to
            resolve the X10 ambiguity regarding which button was
            released.
          The highlight tracking responses are also modified to an SGR-
          like format, using the same SGR-style scheme and button-encod-
          ings.
URXVT (1015)
          The normal mouse response is altered to use CSI followed by
          semicolon-separated encoded button value, the <i>Cx</i> and <i>Cy</i> ordi-
          nates and final character M .
          This uses the same button encoding as X10, but printing it as
          a decimal integer rather than as a single byte.
          However, CSI M  can be mistaken for DL (delete lines), while
          the highlight tracking CSI T  can be mistaken for SD (scroll
          down), and the Window manipulation controls.  For these rea-
          sons, the 1015 control is not recommended; it is not an
          improvement over 1005.

Most of these sequences are standard Tektronix 4014 control sequences.
Graph mode supports the 12-bit addressing of the Tektronix 4014.  The
major features missing are the write-through and defocused modes.  This
document does not describe the commands used in the various Tektronix
plotting modes but does describe the commands to switch modes.
